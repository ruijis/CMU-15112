Description: 

	* This is a two players' dance game, and each player dance on a specific area on screen. Player on the left uses left hand, and Player on the right uses right hand. In terms of dance, player move their thumb, index, and middle fingers on a vertical plane above Leap Motion, which projects on screen. Then by touching rings on buttons in a right way, player can get scores. At the end, two players can compare their points.

	* Rule of the game:
		- for points, touching finger and ring's color should be same, otherwise get penalty. 
		- continuously getting points will be recored as flow number, and satisfying a set number contributes life time.
